# c_experiments - some simple C code snippets

Was playing around with C; trying to freshen my skills.  
Each project is contained off a folder under root.  

In order to build and compile, in my Windows environment,  I installed MinGW and Visual Code.
There are some json mods that need to be done in order to compile and debug in VC; its not hard but its probably more than most people expect.
